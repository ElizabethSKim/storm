### Programming a TinyOS App on Storm

There is a TinyOS port for Storm under development [here](https://github.com/SoftwareDefinedBuildings/stormport). It's a rebasing repository, so be prepared for the default branch to change from time to time.

To make a TinyOS application do:
```
make storm
```
